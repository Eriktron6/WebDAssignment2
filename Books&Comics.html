          <p>In "Star Trek: Defiant," an upcoming comic set to be released in 2023, the narrative takes a unique and
            intriguing turn as someone
            begins targeting the gods themselves. As Captain Benjamin Sisko and the crew of the USS Theseus confront
            threats in the celestial realms,
            they become aware of a very real and escalating casualty count on lower ground. The true adversary in this
            saga is not a deity but a mortal man, a
            dangerous messiah leading a genocidal cult. To counter this threat, Worf of
            House Martok assembles his own crew aboard the USS Defiant. This formidable team, drawn from various eras of
            Star Trek canon, includes iconic
            characters such as Ro Laren, Spock, B'Elanna Torres, Lore, and more. "Star Trek: Defiant" weaves an
            unexpected and captivating narrative, uniting some of the
            most prominent personalities in the Star Trek franchise.
            Their mission to confront the genocidal cult leader is fraught with uncertainty and peril, promising an
            exciting addition to the Star Trek universe in 2023..</p>
