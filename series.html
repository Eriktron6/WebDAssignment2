          <hr>
          <p>
            The third and final season of "Star Trek: Picard" follows the character Jean-Luc Picard in the year 2401
            as he reunites with the former command crew of the USS Enterprise, including Geordi La Forge, Worf,
            William Riker, Beverly Crusher, Deanna Troi, and Data. They face a mysterious enemy who is hunting Picard's
            son.
            A third season of
            "Picard" was informally approved in January 2020, allowing it to be filmed alongside the second season.
            Filming for
            the third season took place in California and ended in March 2022. The return of other Next Generation cast
            members
            was confirmed shortly after. The season aims to provide a satisfying conclusion to Picard's story and the
            Next Generation cast.

            The season premiered on Paramount+ on February 16, 2023, and consisted of 10 episodes, running until April
            20.
            It received positive reviews from critics and garnered nominations for Primetime Emmy Awards and other
            honors.</p>
